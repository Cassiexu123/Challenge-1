## Results
1).Based on the history data, the theater would be most successful once launched during the summer time.
2). Almost all months have a canceled campaign. 
Generally, the lower funding goal, the higher successful rate; the higher funding goal, the higher failed rate.
This data of this dataset is from 2009-2017, it’s a little bit old and probably can’t represent the situation for now. Meanwhile, the dataset only includes “theater/play”, if additional tables or graphs show about more categories, it will be more detailed.
