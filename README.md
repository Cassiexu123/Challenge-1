# Louis’s Crowfunding Campaign Analysis
## Overview of project
Louis wants to start a crowdfunding campaign and help her play.
### Purposes
She needs to know if any specific factors make a project’s campaign successful.I would help her to find the key metrics.
## Analysis and Challenges
To exactly follow up the course material process, the first time I saved imagine for the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date is the bar chart and is related to parent category instead if subcategory. However, once I went back and standed on a high point of the whole project purpose. I realized that I have to save a "Theather Outcomes line chart" to adapt the whole project
## Results
1).Based on the history data, the theater would be most successful once launched during the summer time.
2). Almost all months have a canceled campaign. 
Generally, the lower funding goal, the higher successful rate; the higher funding goal, the higher failed rate.
This data of this dataset is from 2009-2017, it’s a little bit old and probably can’t represent the situation for now. Meanwhile, the dataset only includes “theater/play”, if additional tables or graphs show about more categories, it will be more detailed.
